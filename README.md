# My [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/), [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/) centrered quick-setup environment

After creating a [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html) Arch Linux USB installer, and after running [archinstall](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Archinstall) to setup a Hyprland desktop environment with Ly greeter, I use this repo to setup everything else. It takes me on average about 1-2hrs to install Linux with a fully cloned daily driver environment that is exactly perfect for my workflow

Most of it is automated and it takes me roughly 15-30min of actual time to type things out to automate it down to < 5min

**This repo exists because** I'm exploring generative systems programming and generative filesystems and needed a way to quickly recover and clone environments. It's currently configured as follows:

- [x] Arch Linux with Hyprland window manager
- [ ] Vim with a generative literate programming focus using a hybrid of local and remote AI
- [ ] Design philosophy of minimalism but with some flair
